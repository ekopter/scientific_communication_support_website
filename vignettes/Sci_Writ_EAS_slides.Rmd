## Day 1 {-}

On the first day, we began the series by discussion what "good scientific writing" actually means, and then we talked in more detail about the *mechanics* (content, structure and language) of effective writing.

## Day 2 {-}

On the second day, we continued our discussion about how we can all be good scientific writers, by talking in some detail about the *mentality* (mindset, approach, and workflow) of effective scientific writing. We then discussed the importance and practice of giving and receiving writing feedback.

## Day 1 and 2 Group Input {-}

Because the first two parts of the discussion occurred over zoom, participant input was first solicited via written input into Google Slides, which can been seen here: [Day 1&2 Group input; 01 & 22 June](https://github.com/ekopter/scientific_communication_support_website/blob/main/pdfs/Sci_Writ_EAS_series/Day_1_group_input.pdf){width=100% height=500px}

## Day 3 {-}

On the third day, we discussed important guidelines and norms related the publishing, including affiliations, general acknowledgements, funding acknowledgements, non-English abstracts, and authorship. Our lengthy discussion about determining (co)authorships for papers took place in person, and is briefly summarized on the final slide.
