## [Scientific Writing in the EAS Dept](#EASslides) {-}

Here, you can see my slides (& discussion notes) from the workshop/discussion series about *Scientific Writing in the EAS Department* that took place during lab meetings on June 1st & 22nd, and October 19th, 2022. 


## [Styles in MS Word](#WordStyles) {-}

If you don't already use *Styles* in Microsoft Word, I highly recommend it! Despite what the term suggests, the benefits of using *Styles* go far beyond just aesthetics. Using *Styles* allows you to easily see an overview of the organization of a text that you're writing, which can help you to work out structure and flow. In this post, I go over the ***Why*** and ***How*** of using *Styles* in MS Word.
  
    
    
## [A good title is a simple sticky statement](#Titles) {-}

Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. In this post, I go over what makes for a good title.
  
  
  
## [All About Abstracts](#Abstracts) {-}

Here, you can learn about how to structure an abstract for an original research manuscript (bonus, some of this information also applies to review & other types of articles). 
  
  
  
## [Feedback Framework](#FF) {-}

Here, you can find a tool to help you communicate when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give **authors** a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they'd like, and to give **editors** some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text.
