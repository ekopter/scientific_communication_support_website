The following slides link to the keynote presentations from the workshop/discussion series about *Scientific Writing in the EAS Department* that took place during lab meetings on June 1st & 22nd, and October 19th, 2022.

## Day 1 {-}

On the first day, we began the series by discussing what "effective scientific writing" actually means, and then we talked in more detail about the *mechanics* (content, structure, and language) of effective writing.

## Day 2 {-}

On the second day, we continued our discussion about how we can all be effective scientific writers, by talking in some detail about the *mentality* (mindset, approach, and workflow) of effective scientific writing. We then discussed the importance and practice of giving and receiving writing feedback.

## Day 1 and 2 Group Input {-}

Because the first two parts of the discussion occurred over zoom, participant input was first solicited via written input into Google Slides, which can been seen here: [Day 1 & 2 Group input; 01 & 22 June](https://github.com/ekopter/scientific_communication_support_website/blob/main/pdfs/Sci_Writ_EAS_series/Day_1_group_input.pdf){target="_blank" width=100% height=500px}

## Day 3 {-}

On the third day, we discussed important guidelines and norms related to publishing papers, including affiliations, general acknowledgements, funding acknowledgements, and non-English abstracts. We finished with a lengthy (in-person) discussion about paper authorship (which I have done my best to briefly summarized on the final slide of the presentation linked below).
