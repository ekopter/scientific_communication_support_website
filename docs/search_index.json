My job is to support other department members in the communication of their science to scientific audiences. This includes support with everything from writing papers and grant proposals, to putting together conference presentations, to designing (and coding) data visualizations. If you have any questions or comments, or are interested in receiving my help for something you’re working on, please feel free to contact me. Alie aashbury@ab.mpg.de Bückle 5.27 This website is meant to be a source of support for those looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Please note, this website is still very much under construction! Contents The information on this website is divided into several categories: 2 Alie’s Programs: Details about the specific programs and services that I offer to department members. 3 Scientific Writing: Lists and links of helpful resources related to scientific writing. 4 Scientific Presentations: Coming soon! 5 Data Visualization: Coming soon! 6 Alie’s Blog: Posts about anything related to scientific communication. I built this website with bookdown, using the EAS template made by Kosmas Hench. "],["alies_programs.html", "2 Alie’s Programs Writing Support Writing Solidarity Club Writing Retreat Writing Workshop", " 2 Alie’s Programs The following programs are available to members of the EAS department. Contact me for more info! Writing Support Once each week, I have a slot of ~4 hours which I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. When you “book” the slot, you get up to 4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I’ll spend 3-4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, maybe you only want to meet to discuss some ideas or parts of a writing project that you’re stuck on. Or, maybe you want to give a practice talk for a conference, and receive feedback about your presentation and slides. Basically, it’s totally flexible, so think specifically about what you are hoping that I can help you with, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. Sign up in the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning “Scientific Writing Support with Alie” slot that doesn’t yet have somebody’s name in it. Replace “[Name]” with your name. By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary! Sign up for the Wednesday slot to claim my time that week, but then contact me to sort out an alternative day/time. Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time! If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary. Writing Solidarity Club Note: This program is on hold until further notice. If you are interested in this program, please contact me directly to let me know! Lots of writing to do, but can’t find the motivation? Need extra incentive to block off writing time? Come to Writing Solidarity Club! Bring your laptop and leave your over-active inner-critic behind! It’s writing time! Every Tuesday, from 14:30 to 16:30, I will be writing in Bückle room 4.06 (the conference room next to MPI-AB reception). Anybody is welcome to join! No sign up required. Writing Retreat Writing retreats are an opportunity for department members to enjoy a change of pace and scenery, and devote some quality time to writing up their science in a collective and supportive environment. Each day at a Retreat, we set our goals in the morning, write independently together in a conference room throughout the day, and then reflect/check-in on our progress in the evenings. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided, as well as 2 coffee breaks each day. Participants are also welcome to plan/lead group activities (e.g. walks/hikes/jogs around the area, movie nights, yoga sessions, etc), and take alone time as they need. To get the most out of a Retreat, we want participants to arrive ready to write, which involves some preparatory work ahead of time. About 6 weeks before a Retreat, I’ll check-in with each participant and we’ll discuss what they’ll work on at the Retreat, where they are at in their writing preparation process, and further steps that they need to take before the Retreat (e.g. completing analyses, meeting with a collaborator or supervisor). This fall, we will have our first EAS Writing Retreat at the Hotel St Elisabeth Hegne from November 21st to the 25th. Applications are now closed and the final list of participants has been notified! Stay tuned for info about or next EAS Writing Retreat, which will take place in Spring 2023! Writing Workshop Stay tuned for more information! "],["sci_writ_main.html", "3 Scientific Writing Resources", " 3 Scientific Writing “As a scientist, you are a professional writer.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science “The purpose of science writing is not explaining what you did or what you learned, but rather what you want your audience to understand. Start by asking: Who is my audience? What are their goals in reading my writing? What message do I want them to take away from my writing?” - Turbek et al. 2016 “A scientific research paper is the product of erasure. It’s all that is left over after everything has been stripped off except for exactly what needs to be there.” - Judy Swan “You succeed as a scientist by getting [your papers] cited.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science The above quotes highlight several key qualities of effective scientific writing &amp; writers. To be an effective scientific writer…. You need to understand the importance of writing well. Invest in yourself as a writer. Take the time to learn and improve. You should write for your audience - every word, sentence, and paragraph that you write should be chosen and crafted to convey a specific message to your audience. You should write concisely. You need to cut clutter that will distract your audience from your main message. Your overarching goal is to get cited; It is not enough to get published - people actually need to use your work. Only when others are citing your work - because they are discussing it, building off it, or using it to inform their own work - has your research truly become part of the scientific body of knowledge. Resources Books When I find books about scientific writing that I think are really good and helpful, I will list them here and also ask that they be ordered for our department. So you should be able to find the following books on our 5th floor mini library: Writing Science by Joshua Schimel Scientific Writing and Communication by Angelika H. Hoffman Papers Simple rules for concise scientific writing; Hotaling 2020 is a great paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and writing scientific papers, with a focus on keeping things “tight” and concise. Ten simple rules for structuring papers, Mensh &amp; Kording 2017 is an excellent paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and structuring a paper, so as to make it as easy as possible for your audience to understand your message. Finding the “Pitch” in Ecological Writing, Cahill et al. 2011 is about how to approach writing a scientific paper, such that it is catchy and sticks with your readers. Online resources The Duke Graduate School Scientific Writing Resource consists of 3 sections (lessons) all aimed at teaching you how to write more effectively. In this lecture, entitled Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks, Judy Swan discusses what makes for good writing, and how to get readers to pay the most attention to what you think is the most important. Courses Writing in the Sciences, offered by Stanford University on Coursera, is a free class that covers big-picture and detailed nitty-gritty best practices of scientific writing. The focus is on original research manuscripts, but review papers and grant proposals and other types of written work are also covered. The course also reviews the writing process, with tips for how to approach writing projects. Although the examples are mostly taken from medical/clinical research, the lessons are taught clearly and can easily be applied to ecology/animal behavior research. Suggestions? If you come across a good scientific writing resource, please let me know about it!

Styles in MS Word If you don’t already use Styles in Microsoft Word, I highly recommend it! Despite what the term suggests, the benefits of using Styles go far beyond just aesthetics. Using Styles allows you to easily see an overview of the organization of a text that you’re writing, which can help you to work out structure and flow. In this post, I go over the Why and How of using Styles in MS Word. A good title is a simple sticky statement Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. In this post, I go over what makes for a good title. All About Abstracts Here, you can learn about how to structure an abstract for an original research manuscript (bonus, some of this information also applies to review &amp; other types of articles). Feedback Framework Here, you can find a tool to help you communicate when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give authors a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they’d like, and to give editors some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text. "],["FF.html", "Feedback Framework Preliminary questions The categories of writing feedback", " Feedback Framework The following information is meant to assist you when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give authors a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they’d like, and to give editors some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text. It is important to remember that: Writing is not a linear process - i.e. although most papers start with planning and end with polishing, they do not necessarily progress from planning to polishing in a linear sequential way, e.g. a paper may move back and forth between planning and content a few times, or a re-structuring might be necessary along with the ‘final’ polishing edits; and These categories are not discrete - e.g. when planning, you will of course consider content and structure, or adjustments to language may precipitate adjustments to structure, and vice-versa. The important thing here is that you - as an author - can articulate the type(s) of feedback that you want/need at any given time, and that you - as an editor - can understand the type(s) of feedback that an author is asking for. Preliminary questions When you ask for, or are asked to give, writing feedback, first discuss the following questions with the author/editor: What are the requirements for this text? / What is the planned destination for this text? / Who is the audience for this text? (ex. If a grant proposal, what does the granting agency want to see in the proposal?; If a journal article, what journal(s) is the author considering submitting to?; etc) What is the current status of the text and what type of feedback does the author want? (see below) What, in particular (a certain idea/concept or a particular section), is the author struggling with or wanting help on? The categories of writing feedback Planning The author: - is still chewing over ideas - has done a lot of reading &amp; research - has some notes - has a rough outline/overview While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: What is/are the main point/s the author wants to make? What is the overarching story of this text? What does the audience need to know in order for the author’s main point/s to have an impact? The editor should: - familiarize themselves (if they are not already) with the general topic / study system / field of research - discuss the project with the author - clarify questions/aims/goals of the text - identify areas where further reading &amp; research is needed - help to develop an approach, structure, and maybe an outline Content The author: - has a first draft (though it’s not pretty, and many ideas may be still half-baked) or at least a thorough outline - has thought about out the general content - has a preliminary idea of the over-arching structure of the text While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: Is the central idea of the text framed in an interesting and engaging way? Is the author’s main point clearly explained, and enough background/ contextual information given for it to make sense? Does the framing/contextualization of the topic make clear why this topic/problem is important? Is anything missing? Does anything seem superfluous/unnecessary? Does every method have a result and vice versa? Do the data and analysis support the conclusions? The editor should: - use comments to put feedback into the text - identify areas that aren’t clear, ideas that don’t fit, and concepts that are missing - only note language-related edits when necessary to clarify the meaning of a sentence - focus on the content of the text and not on how it is written Structure The author: - has a full draft of the text - has basically finalized the draft content, and fully fleshed out the ideas While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: Does each sentence, paragraph, and section have a clear point/message? Can you quickly and easily summarize the topic/focus of each paragraph? Generally, does each paragraph begin with a topic sentence, end with an emphasis or concluding sentence, and have supporting information in the middle? Is information all in the right places (background, knowledge gap, approach in Intro; no Methods mixed in with the Results; no Discussion/interpretation mixed in with the Results; etc)? Are topics/foci presented in the same order through all sections of the text? The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - add comments where more extensive edits are needed - identify information that is out of place - check for parallel structure(s) - check paragraph structures - focus more on where information/ideas are presented, and on the ordering of these, and less on how it is written Language The author: - has a full, well-structured draft of the text While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: As you read through, where do you get stuck or confused? How could problem areas be changed to improve readability? Does each sentence flow nicely from the next? Are details introduced properly and relationally? Check for: run-on sentences, noun-verb accordance, proper punctuation, etc The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - add comments to explain changes and to highlight recurring errors - identify passages that may need to be rewritten or reworked for more clarification - note ideas or suggestions of how to change problem passages (in comments or track-changes) - focus on how the text is written, be thorough Polishing The author: - has the text finished and in its “final” form - has a submission deadline (if applicable) quickly approaching While working through the text, the editor should check that: …jargon is defined, abbreviations are written out in full the first time, terminology is consistent throughout the text, punctuation is used correctly, etc The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - put in as few changes as possible to ensure clarity and readability of the text - mark awkward sentences/sections as needing to be reworked – make suggestions of how, if possible - try to preserve the author’s writing as much as possible, while still ensuring clarity and flow Back to Blog main page "],["Abstracts.html", "All About Abstracts Overall content of an abstract Abstract recipe When to write your abstract Annotated abstracts", " All About Abstracts The following information is meant to assist you when you’re writing an abstract for an original research manuscript (though, some of this information will also apply to review &amp; other types of articles). Most journals ask for abstracts with a word limit somewhere between 200-300 words, and - unless instructed otherwise - it’s safe to assume that you should follow a pretty standard format, essentially one that condenses the main parts of your paper, from introduction to conclusion. Remember that, aside from the title, the abstract is the part of your paper that will get read the most, so don’t let it be an afterthought! Put time into crafting an abstract that is clear, concise, interesting, and does justice to your study and full paper. Overall content of an abstract Regardless of the length and specific journal requirements for your abstract, essentially all abstracts should contain the 3 Cs: Context, Content, and Conclusion (Mensh &amp; Kording 2017). Context: Information about the background and/or knowledge gap of this topic. Why should your reader care about your study? Why does your study matter? Why was your study necessary? What knowledge gap did you intend to fill? What research question did you intend to answer? Content: A brief description of what you did and what you found. How did you approach filling the knowledge gap / answering your research question? What was your study system? What did the data show? What were your major results? Conclusion: A summary of the interpretation of your results and their importance. How does this fill the knowledge gap / answer your original question? Why do your results matter? What does your study contribute to this body of knowledge? For abstracts that must be less than ~150 words, you may need to get creative to fit in all of this information. For abstracts of 200+ words, I recommend following the general recipe below… Abstract recipe The following recipe is meant to provide a very basic overview of the standard structure for a 200-300 word abstract. However, it is meant to be a guide, not a rigid rule list! Background, what is known (~1 sentence) Gap, unknown, problem (~1 sentence) Research aim, question, hypothesis (~1 sentence) Approach, study system, methods (~1-2 sentences) Key results, important stats/numbers (~1-3 sentences) Conclusion, answer the question, fill the gap (~1 sentence) Broader implications, meaning, recommendation (~1 sentence) While the general order of Context (#1, #2), Content (#3, #4, #5), and Conclusion (#6, #7) shouldn’t be changed, within these categories there is wiggle room. It is not uncommon for the order of #3 and #4 to be switched (approach and then research aim), nor for the order of #5 and #6 to be switched (overarching conclusion and then specific results). Furthermore, especially where there is a very small word limit, it may be possible to omit #2 (the knowledge gap), as it is implied by #1 (background) and/or #3 (research aims), and/or to collapse #3 (research aims) and #4 (approach) into a single statement. It is always important to check and see if the journal has any specific requirements for abstracts. For example, Nature asks for a “summary paragraph” rather an an “abstract” per se. If you are at all unsure of how to construct an abstract, and if the journal does not give any specifics of how they want it (beyond a simple word limit), following the above recipe is generally a good place to start. When to write your abstract Although everybody’s process is different, it can be a very valuable exercise to write a paper’s abstract first, before writing any of the rest of the paper. If you can fill in all of the ingredients for the recipe above, then you are ready to write your paper. You can then use your abstract as a road map to guide your paper-writing. As you write your paper, and your thinking develops, continue to check back to the abstract and edit/adjust your abstract, or your paper, as necessary. Damien Farine has a great blog post over on academic life histories about how to use your abstract to improve your paper-writing. If you are struggling to satisfy any of the parts of the recipe, then you may need to do more background research, discussing with co-authors, or analysis before you are ready to write your paper. Whatever your process, I encourage you to not leave the abstract until the end, just prior to submission. Remember that it is one of the absolute most important parts of the entire paper, and it should receive the same - if not more - scrutiny (by yourself, co-authors, and others who help to edit your work) as the rest of the paper! Annotated abstracts Here are a few examples of abstracts, which I’ve annotated in accordance with the above abstract recipe… Back to Blog main page "],["Titles.html", "A good title is a simple sticky statement Some good examples", " A good title is a simple sticky statement Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. A good title is a straight-forward statement that communicates a simple message. My general advice for titles is: Make your title the single sticky message that you want your readers to remember; if you can, avoid using a super general statement about the overarching topic of your paper. Don’t use jokes, puns, and references to pop culture; these can confuse - or even deter - potential audience members, as many people (especially those from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds) may not ‘get’ the reference. Two-part titles can be effective - as long as you ensure that both parts of the title directly reflect your main message, but are not redundant. Don’t over-use two-part titles (consider that it’s possible that one part of your two-part title is actually completely unnecessary). I think that the following passage, from Mensh &amp; Kording 2017, does a great job of explaining why a good title is so important, and how considering your title early on can actually help you to write a better paper overall: “The title not only transmits the paper’s central contribution but can also serve as a constant reminder (to you) to focus the text on transmitting that idea. Science is, after all, the abstraction of simple principles from complex data. The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper’s contribution. Thinking about the title early — and regularly returning to hone it — can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories.” — Mensh &amp; Kording 2017; pg. 2 – This passage highlights two important points: Your title should be a distilled statement of your paper’s main message, i.e. it is the “ultimate refinement” of the main message/idea that your paper is all about. You can use the exercise of thinking about and writing your title as a means to help you focus your thinking and your writing of the paper as a whole. Don’t leave writing your title until the very end, instead have it be the first thing you write, and then come back to rethink and refine it as often as necessary as you write the rest of your paper. Some good examples Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015 An excellent title: Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons Why it’s so good: It clearly communicates the main, and exciting, finding (“shared decision-making drives collective moment”) and the study system (“wild baboons”), including the main topics/components of the study (“decision-making,” “collective movement,” and “wild baboons”). It’s short, straight-forward, and sticky: audiences can easily understand and remember this as the main finding of the paper. It also gives insight into not only the study system (“baboons”) but also the approach - the inclusion of the word “wild” suggests to readers that this paper is likely be based on field observations under natural conditions. Less good alternatives: I can imagine a few other, less ideal, titles that the authors could have chosen… Ex 1: How do wild baboons decide where to go? While this captures the main topics/components of the study (“decision-making,” “movement,” “baboons”), it doesn’t actually give the reader any new information. Question titles can be catchy, especially if they ask a question that everybody is already thinking, but what is even better is to actually answer that question up-front—not make the reader comb through the paper to find the answer. Ex 2: Collective decision-making in wild baboons. Again, this title captures the main topics/components of the study, and it’s also quite simple. However, it fails to convey anything about the study’s findings, and so suggests that the study’s results will be anything but straight-forward. While it absolutely can be the case that a study’s results are impossible to condense into a single sticky statement, and a general topic title such as this one may be the best choice, it should only be used as a last resort - after every effort is made to conceptualize and collect results into a single key message. Ex 3: Collective movement in a group-living wild primate: baboons exhibit shared decision-making when choosing when and where to move. While this captures all of the main topics/components, as well as the main finding of the study, it’s not simple… because it’s so long and wordy, it’s more challenging for the audience to parse and to remember: it’s not sticky. This use of the two-part title also includes a lot of redundancy: “a group-living wild primate” and “baboons,” “collective movement” and “when and where to move,” and “decisions-making” and “choosing.” The real title of the paper conveys essentially all of the same information as this alternative but in 9 words instead of 20. Ehmann et al. 2021 An excellent title: Immature wild orangutans acquire relevant ecological knowledge through sex-specific attentional biases during social learning Why it’s so good: It clearly communicates the main, and exciting, finding (“ecological knowledge is acquired through sex-specific attentional biases”) and the study system (“wild orangutans”), including the main topics/components of the study (“immature orangutans,” “ecological knowledge,” “attentional biases” and “social learning”). It’s straight-forward, and pretty sticky: audiences can easily understand and remember this as the main finding of the paper. It also gives insight into not only the study system (“orangutans”) but also the approach - the inclusion of the word “wild” suggests to readers that this paper is likely be based on field observations under natural conditions. It’s not a particularly short title, but I think in this case that’s ok: it’s long because stating the main finding requires several words, and not because it is unnecessarily wordy. I think you could argue, though, that the “during social learning” at the end of the title could maybe have been left off without losing any vital information or obscuring the overall message. Less good alternatives: I can imagine a few other, less ideal, titles that we could have chosen… Ex 1: Growing up in the trees: Immature wild orangutans acquire relevant ecological knowledge through sex-specific attentional biases. This two part title is hardly any longer than the original title, but - rather than emphasizing that these attentional biases occur during social learning, it emphasizes that orangutans are arboreal. Although this is not incorrect, the fact that orangutans are arboreal is not at all important for the framing or main findings of this study. The study does not discuss or analyze the influence of orangutans’ arboreal adaptations or lifestyle on immatures’ attentional biases, so although “growing up in the trees” is true, and maybe gives some contextual information about orangutans’ ecology, it’s not a main point/topic of the study and thus does not belong in the title. Ex 2: Attentional biases among wild immature orangutans. Like example 2 above, this title captures the main topics/components of the study and is simple, but it fails to convey anything about the study’s findings. It’s not very informative, nor exciting, and as such, is not sticky. Back to Blog main page "],["WordStyles.html", "Styles in MS Word The basic principle The Advantages How it works Some basic alternatives Adding a TOC Beware", " Styles in MS Word If you don’t already use Styles in Microsoft Word, I highly recommend it! Despite what the term suggests, the benefits of using Styles go far beyond just aesthetics. Using Styles allows you to easily see an overview of the organization of a text that you’re writing, which can help you to work out structure and flow. The following is a brief introduction to the way that I use MS Word Styles when I’m writing a manuscript. Of course, there are a lot of additional (and alternative) ways to use Styles, but here is somewhere to start if you’re new to this. The basic principle Imagine that you want to write a text in Times New Roman (TNR) font, with 3 levels of headings: 1) main section headings in bold Arial font, 2) subsection headings in bold TNR font, and 3) sub-sub-headings in TNR italic font. You have two options: You can manually (in the HOME tab) change the font to TNR, start typing, and then anytime you type a heading, you highlight that text and change the font and/or bold/italics. This is the most obvious and common way to do this. ALTERNATIVELY, you can use Styles to “tell” Word what you want your normal text, main headings, subsections headings, and sub-sub-headings to look like. Then, you “tell” Word which text is just normal text, and which is each kind of heading, and it assigns the aesthetic properties that you’ve selected. The Advantages By using Styles (rather than direct manual formatting), you gain 2 major advantages: If you, later, decide that you want to change the aesthetic properties of your paper - let’s say that actually you want main section headings to be Arial bold and italics, and bright red! - you don’t have to go through and change each section heading. You can simply update the Headings style, and all text that has been assigned to that style will be changed. MS Word will recognize which text is actually your headings, subheadings, and sub-sub-headings, etc. This will allow Word to easily construct a table of contents, and also show you the headings structure in the sidebar as you work - allowing you to always see an overview of the text that you’re writing. How it works The following instructions and screenshots are from MS Word for Mac v16.12 - so you’re might look a bit different, but the basic principles should be the same… Open a blank MS Word document, and go to View &gt; Sidebar &gt; Navigation. In the HOME tab, click on the button that says Styles Pane.You should see something that looks like this, with a blank sidebar down the left side, and the Styles Pane on the left… Hover your cursor over the button that says Normal until you see the down arrow on the right. Click on that, and then on “Modify Style.” In the window that pops up, choose the font formatting to be what you want for the default, main text, of your writing. In this case, I’ve changed it to TNR, size 11. Click “OK.” Now, repeat steps 3 and 4 for each Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3 - changing each style to be what you want (in this case, I am making them all size 11 &amp; black, and then Arial bold, TNR bold, and TNR italics respectively.) Note how the look of the different styles changes in the Styles Pane and also in the buttons across the top HOME tab ribbon. You can now close the Styles Pane and begin typing. Type some titles and some text. Highlight text that you want to be each type of style, and then click the appropriate button in the HOME tab ribbon…   Notice how, as you highlight text and assign it a heading style, it will appear in the Navigation Bar on the left side of the screen. Subheadings will be indented under their over-headings. This is a really excellent way for you, your co-authors, and your proof-readers/reviewers to see the full overview of your MS. If you decide later that you want to change the aesthetics of a style - let’s say that you want the subheadings (Heading 2) to be red, you can reopen the Styles Pane, and modify Heading 2 to be red. When you click “OK,” you’ll see that all text which had been assigned to the style Heading 2 has been updated to be red. You can already see in this example that I have used superfluous subheadings - of course, for most journal article manuscripts, you wouldn’t include subheadings for “Background” and “Knowledge Gap.” However, I highly recommend doing this in early drafts. I will often even use a 4th level of subheadings (i.e., Heading 4 style) to give a little title to each paragraph. This makes it really easy to see the overall structure of the paper and to see if/where information might be missing, or superfluous and unnecessary. I especially find this useful in the Methods and Results sections, where I like to include sub(subsub)headings that allow me to see very clearly if each result has a corresponding data collection and/or statistic test method section, and vice versa. Some basic alternatives Of course, you can always start to assign styles to a document that you’ve already started, or finished, writing. You can simply set the aesthetics of the styles that you want, and then go through your text and highlight the different components and click on the style buttons in the HOME tab ribbon. Another way of setting style aesthetics is to: In the document itself, change the aesthetics of a piece of text using the regular font formatting tools (in the HOME tab ribbon, or under Format &gt; Font…). You have likely already been doing this as you typed your text. Open the Styles Pane. Highlight the text that already has the aesthetic properties that you want, but that you want to assign to a specific style. In the Styles Pane, find the name of the specific style that you want the highlighted text to be (in the case of the below example, I want Heading 4 to be size 10, TNR, light grey, italics), hover your cursor over the name, and then click on the down arrow on the right side. Select “Update to Match Selection.” Now, that formatting has been applied to the Headings 4 style. Also, if any other text in the document has already been classified as Headings 4, it will be changed to these new aesthetics. (Note, however, that other text which has that similar formatting, but has not yet been designated as Headings 4 style, will need to be explicitly manually designated, it will not happen automatically.) Adding a TOC While I generally use Styles for the sake of easy mass-aesthetic changes and the usefulness of the Navigation sidebar, you may find that you occasionally want to make a table of contents (TOC). To do this, first put your cursor where you want your table of contents to be (usually the beginning of your document). Then click on the REFERENCES tab and choose Table of Contents from the ribbon, and pick a format from the drop-down menu. Note that, in a cruel twist of fate, table of contents entries have their OWN styles (separate from Headings styles), so the aesthetics that you’ve applied to your heading styles won’t transfer over into the TOC, only the content of those styles (i.e. the text). Super annoying. If you want to change the aesthetics of your table of contents, reopen the Styles Pane in your document, and - now that you’ve added a table of contents - you will see new styles called TOC 1, TOC 2, etc. You can update/modify these styles to match your Heading styles (or not, whatever you want!). Beware There are 2 ways in which using styles can mess you up: First, when you modify the aesthetics of a style, all text that has been assigned to that style will be updated to the new aesthetics. If you have manually (without using styles, just using font formatting tools directly) changed some text’s aesthetics in your document to be different than its assigned style’s aesthetics, it will now get updated to match the new (and other!) modified aesthetics of that style. For example, let’s say that your Normal (i.e. default) aesthetics is TNR size 12. Your reference list is assigned to the Normal style but you have gone ahead and highlighted that section and changed the font size 10. Later, you decide that you want the Normal text to actually be a sans serif font, so you update the Normal style to be Arial (still size 12). Now, ALL text that has been assigned to the Normal style, will be updated! INCLUDING your reference list, which will change from TNR size 10, to Arial size 12 (i.e. you will lose the manual formatting that you did to reduce the size). The way around this is to generally always avoid doing any manual formatting. If you want to change the aesthetics of any text, such as the reference list, or maybe text in a table or in a figure caption, MAKE A NEW “New Style” FOR THAT TYPE OF TEXT. There is a button near the top of the Styles Pane where you can select “New Style…” and give it a name and aesthetic properties. Make a References style, and a table text style, and a figure caption style, rather than just directly formatting the font for these different types of text. Second, it is important to note that styles do not just include font aesthetics, but also other stylistic aspects. The one that often trips me up is paragraph formatting - here, the line spacing and indentation properties of text get encoded in the style. This is helpful if you want to, for example, have a special style for your reference list that includes the unique indentation properties of reference lists (usually, the first line of each ‘paragraph’ is flush with the left margin, while subsequent lines are indented… basically the opposite of regular paragraph indentation patterns). But it also means that you can fall into the above (first) trap with respect to paragraph formatting, not just font formatting. So if you manually set your text to be at 1.5 spacing, but then you update your Normal style to, say, a different font size (but the style’s line spacing is still set to the original 1.0), everything will switch back to 1.0 spacing. The way to avoid these issues are, therefore, to be mindful of the paragraph formatting associated with each style, as well as the font formatting.
