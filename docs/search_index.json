My job is to support other department members in the communication of their science to scientific audiences. This includes support with everything from writing papers and grant proposals, to putting together conference presentations, to designing (and coding) data visualizations. If you have any questions or comments, or are interested in receiving my help for something you’re working on, please feel free to contact me. Alie aashbury@ab.mpg.de Bückle 5.27 This website is meant to be a source of support for those looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Please note, this website is still very much under construction! Contents The information on this website is divided into several categories: Alie’s Programs: Details about the specific programs and services that I offer to department members. Scientific Writing: Lists and links of helpful resources related to scientific writing. Scientific Presentations: Coming soon! Data Visualization: Coming soon! I built this website with bookdown, using the EAS template made by Kosmas Hench. "],["alies-programs.html", "2 Alie’s Programs Writing Support Writing Solidarity Club Writing Retreat Writing Workshop", " 2 Alie’s Programs The following programs are available to members of the EAS department. Contact me for more info! Writing Support Once each week, I have a slot of ~4 hours which I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. When you “book” the slot, you get up to 4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I’ll spend 3-4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, maybe you only want to meet to discuss some ideas or parts of a writing project that you’re stuck on. Or, maybe you want to give a practice talk for a conference, and receive feedback about your presentation and slides. Basically, it’s totally flexible, so think specifically about what you are hoping that I can help you with, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. Sign up in the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning “Scientific Writing Support with Alie” slot that doesn’t yet have somebody’s name in it. Replace “[Name]” with your name. By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary! Sign up for the Wednesday slot to claim my time that week, but then contact me to sort out an alternative day/time. Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time! If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary. Writing Solidarity Club Note: This program is on hold until further notice. If you are interested in this program, please contact me directly to let me know! Lots of writing to do, but can’t find the motivation? Need extra incentive to block off writing time? Come to Writing Solidarity Club! Bring your laptop and leave your over-active inner-critic behind! It’s writing time! Every Tuesday, from 14:30 to 16:30, I will be writing in Bückle room 4.06 (the conference room next to MPI-AB reception). Anybody is welcome to join! No sign up required. Writing Retreat Stay tuned for more information! Writing Workshop Stay tuned for more information! "],["scientific-writing.html", "3 Scientific Writing Resources", " 3 Scientific Writing “As a scientist, you are a professional writer.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science “The purpose of science writing is not explaining what you did or what you learned, but rather what you want your audience to understand. Start by asking: Who is my audience? What are their goals in reading my writing? What message do I want them to take away from my writing?” - Turbek et al. 2016 “A scientific research paper is the product of erasure. It’s all that is left over after everything has been stripped off except for exactly what needs to be there.” - Judy Swan “You succeed as a scientist by getting [your papers] cited.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science The above quotes highlight several key qualities of effective scientific writing/writers. In other words, to be an effective scientific writer, You must understand the importance of writing well. Invest in yourself as a writer. Take the time to learn and improve. You should write for your audience - every word, sentence, and paragraph that you write should be chosen and crafted to convey a specific message to your audience. You should write concisely. You need to cut clutter that will distract your audience from your main message. Your overarching goal is to get cited: It is not enough to get published - people actually need to use your work. Only when other scientists are citing your work - whether to discuss, evaluate, or build on it - has your research truly become part of the scientific body of knowledge. Resources Books When I find books about scientific writing that I think are really good and helpful, I will list them here and also ask that they be ordered for our department. So you should be able to find the following books on our 5th floor mini library (if not yet, then soon!). Writing Science by Joshua Schimel Scientific Writing and Communication by Angelika H. Hoffman Papers Simple rules for concise scientific writing; Hotaling 2020 is a great paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and writing scientific papers. Finding the “Pitch” in Ecological Writing, Cahill et al. 2011 is about how to approach writing a scientific paper, such that it is catchy and sticks with your readers. Online resources The Duke Graduate School Scientific Writing Resource consists of 3 sections (lessons) all aimed at teaching you how to write more effectively. In this lecture, entitled Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks, Judy Swan discusses what makes for good writing, and how to get readers to pay the most attention to what you think is the most important. Courses Writing in the Sciences, offered by Stanford University on Coursera, is a free class that covered big-picture and detailed nitty-gritty best practices of scientific writing. The focus is on original research manuscripts, but review papers and grant proposals and other types of written work are also covered. The course also reviews the writing process, with tips for how to approach writing projects. Although the examples are mostly taken from medical/clinical research, the lessons are taught clearly and can easily be applied to ecology/animal behavior research. Suggestions? If you come across a good scientific writing resource, please let me know about it! Other The following are resources that I’ve come across, but haven’t yet had a chance to read through and fully vet. When I do, if I like them, I’ll move them to the lists above. For now, I’m just keeping track of them here… 10 Simple Steps to Writing a Scientific Paper How to Write a Good Scientific Paper "]]
