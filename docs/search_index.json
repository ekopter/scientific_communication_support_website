I’m Alie, the EAS department’s Scientific Writer. My job is to support other department members in the communication of their science to scientific audiences. This includes support with everything from writing papers and grant proposals, to putting together conference presentations, to designing (and coding) data visualizations. If you have any questions or comments, or are interested in receiving my help for something you’re working on, please feel free to contact me. Alie aashbury@ab.mpg.de Bückle 5.27 This website is meant to be a source of support for those looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Please note, this website is still very much under construction! 1.1 Contents The information on this website is divided into several categories: Alie’s Programs: Details about the specific programs and services that Alie offers to department members I built this website with bookdown, using the EAS template made by Kosmas Hench.

Contact me for more info! 2.1 Writing Support Once each week, I have a slot of ~4 hours which I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary. When you “book” the slot, you get up to 4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I’ll spend 3 or 4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, we can meet right away at the beginning of the slot, and have a discussion about how best I can help you, and then separate and I take some time alone to look at your document. Or, maybe you only want to meet and discuss some ideas or parts of the writing that you’re stuck on, that’s fine too! Basically, it’s totally flexible, so think about what you are hoping to get from me, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. 2.1.1 How to sign up In the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning “Scientific Writing Support with Alie” slot that doesn’t yet have somebody’s name in it. Replace “[Name]” with your name. Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time! If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary.
