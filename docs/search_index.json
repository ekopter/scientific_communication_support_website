My job is to support other department members in the communication of their science to scientific audiences. This includes support with everything from writing papers and grant proposals, to putting together conference presentations, to designing (and coding) data visualizations. If you have any questions or comments, or are interested in receiving my help for something you’re working on, please feel free to contact me. Alie aashbury@ab.mpg.de Bückle 5.27 This website is meant to be a source of support for those looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Please note, this website is still very much under construction! Contents The information on this website is divided into several categories: 2 Alie’s Programs: Details about the specific programs and services that I offer to department members. 3 Scientific Writing: Lists and links of helpful resources related to scientific writing. 4 Scientific Presentations: Coming soon! 5 Data Visualization: Coming soon! 6 Alie’s Blog: Posts about anything related to scientific communication. I built this website with bookdown, using the EAS template made by Kosmas Hench. "],["alies_programs.html", "2 Alie’s Programs Writing Support Co-Writing Thursdays Writing Retreat", " 2 Alie’s Programs The following programs are available to members of the EAS department. Contact me for more info! Writing Support Once each week, I have a slot of time that I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. When you book the slot, you get ~4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I’ll spend 3-4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, maybe you want to brainstorm and discuss some ideas or parts of a writing project that you’re stuck on, or having trouble even starting. Or, maybe you want to give a practice talk for a conference, and receive feedback about your presentation and slides. Basically, it’s totally flexible, so think specifically about what you are hoping that I can help you with, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. An important thing to note: If what you want is for me to look over a draft manuscript and provide feedback, you should have received (and implemented) feedback from at least one other “outsider” (not a co-author) before coming to me :) You can find more info about getting (and giving!) feedback here: Feedback is your Friend. Sign up in the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning “Scientific Writing Support with Alie” slot that doesn’t yet have somebody’s name in it. Replace “[Name]” with your name. If you are not a member of the EAS department, or don’t have access to the EAS calendar, email me directly! By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary! Sign up for the Wednesday slot to claim my time that week, but then contact me to sort out an alternative day/time. Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time! If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary. Co-Writing Thursdays Co-writing days take place every Thursday, and up to 4 people can join each day. We start at 9am and write until 5pm, following a set schedule of writing blocks and breaks. During writing sessions, we sit together in the same room and work quietly and independently on our own writing - writing together in this way can help with motivation and staying focused. If you’d like to participate in a co-writing day, sign up here! Don’t hesitate to sign up for multiple Thursdays, and/or to sign up far in advance! If there are no open spots, add your name to the waitlist and check back the day before to see if a slot has opened up! We need a minimum of 2 participants for the co-writing day to take place. Please check the sign up sheet on Wednesday at 17:00; Unfortunately, if you are the only person signed up for the next day, then co-writing is cancelled, sorry!! Writing Retreat Writing retreats are an opportunity for department members to enjoy a change of pace and scenery, and devote some quality time to writing up their science in a collective and supportive environment. Each day at a Retreat, we set our goals in the morning, write independently together in a conference room throughout the day, and then reflect/check-in on our progress in the evenings. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided, as well as 2 coffee breaks each day. Participants are also welcome to plan/lead group activities (e.g. walks/hikes/jogs around the area, movie nights, yoga sessions, etc), and take alone time as they need. To get the most out of a Retreat, we want participants to arrive ready to write, which involves some preparatory work ahead of time. At least 6 weeks before a Retreat, I check-in with each participant and we discuss what they’ll work on at the Retreat, where they are at in their writing preparation process, and further steps that they need to take before the Retreat (e.g. completing analyses, meeting with a collaborator or supervisor). Participants are welcome to reach out to me for any support they need to prepare for writing at the Retreat. When a Writing Retreat is planned and applications are open, I will circulate information about the Retreat and how to apply via email, Mattermost, and department meetings. "],["sci_writ_main.html", "3 Scientific Writing Resources", " 3 Scientific Writing “As a scientist, you are a professional writer.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science “The purpose of science writing is not explaining what you did or what you learned, but rather what you want your audience to understand. Start by asking: Who is my audience? What are their goals in reading my writing? What message do I want them to take away from my writing?” - Turbek et al. 2016 “A scientific research paper is the product of erasure. It’s all that is left over after everything has been stripped off except for exactly what needs to be there.” - Judy Swan “You succeed as a scientist by getting [your papers] cited.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science The above quotes highlight several key qualities of effective scientific writing &amp; writers. To be an effective scientific writer…. You need to understand the importance of writing well. Invest in yourself as a writer. Take the time to learn and improve. You should write for your audience - every word, sentence, and paragraph that you write should be chosen and crafted to convey a specific message to your audience. You should write concisely. You need to cut clutter that will distract your audience from your main message. Your overarching goal is to get cited; It is not enough to get published - people actually need to use your work. Only when others are citing your work - because they are discussing it, building off it, or using it to inform their own work - has your research truly become part of the scientific body of knowledge. Resources Books When I find books about scientific writing that I think are really good and helpful, I will list them here and also ask that they be ordered for our department. So you should be able to find the following books on our 5th floor mini library: Writing Science by Joshua Schimel Scientific Writing and Communication by Angelika H. Hoffman Papers Simple rules for concise scientific writing; Hotaling 2020 is a great paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and writing scientific papers, with a focus on keeping things “tight” and concise. Ten simple rules for structuring papers, Mensh &amp; Kording 2017 is an excellent paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and structuring a paper, so as to make it as easy as possible for your audience to understand your message. Finding the “Pitch” in Ecological Writing, Cahill et al. 2011 is about how to approach writing a scientific paper, such that it is catchy and sticks with your readers. Online resources The Duke Graduate School Scientific Writing Resource consists of 3 sections (lessons) all aimed at teaching you how to write more effectively. In this lecture, entitled Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks, Judy Swan discusses what makes for good writing, and how to get readers to pay the most attention to what you think is the most important. Courses Writing in the Sciences, offered by Stanford University on Coursera, is a free class that covers big-picture and detailed nitty-gritty best practices of scientific writing. The focus is on original research manuscripts, but review papers and grant proposals and other types of written work are also covered. The course also reviews the writing process, with tips for how to approach writing projects. Although the examples are mostly taken from medical/clinical research, the lessons are taught clearly and can easily be applied to ecology/animal behavior research. Suggestions? If you come across a good scientific writing resource, please let me know about it! Other The following are resources that I’ve come across, but haven’t yet had a chance to read through and fully vet. When I do, if I like them, I’ll move them to the lists above.

There is no hard rule that says one must follow this structure, but if you are feeling like you don’t know what you’re doing, and what to write where, this might be a helpful place to start. Proper Paragraphing Paragraphs can be thought of as the basic building blocks of a text. Proper paragraphing is vital in scientific writing: if an author hasn’t properly ‘chunked’ their writing, then the audience can’t properly ‘chunk’ their reading and interpretation. In this post, I go over the basic tenants of effective paragraphing and effective paragraphs. Scientific Writing in the EAS Dept Here, you can see my slides (&amp; discussion notes) from the workshop/discussion series about Scientific Writing in the EAS Department that took place during lab meetings on June 1st &amp; 22nd, and October 19th, 2022. Styles in MS Word If you don’t already use Styles in Microsoft Word, I highly recommend it! Despite what the term suggests, the benefits of using Styles go far beyond just aesthetics. Using Styles allows you to easily see an overview of the organization of a text that you’re writing, which can help you to work out structure and flow. In this post, I go over the Why and How of using Styles in MS Word. A good title is a simple sticky statement Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. In this post, I go over what makes for a good title. All About Abstracts Here, you can learn about how to structure an abstract for an original research manuscript (bonus, some of this information also applies to review &amp; other types of articles). Feedback is your Friend How can we know if our scientific writing is effective? How can we know if our audience is deriving the correct meaning from our writing? How can we know if they are achieving this relatively quickly and painlessly? We can ask them! This post is all about giving and receiving scientific writing feedback.

Depth of Feedback When asking for feedback Feedback Foci &amp; Format", " Feedback is your Friend Our goal when we write up our science is not to document what we have done, but to communicate it. And, as Joshua Schimel says in Writing Science, “It is the author’s job to make the reader’s job easy.” In other words, whether or not we are successful in our scientific writing depends on whether or not our audience is able to - without any undo hardship - understand our message. So, how can we know if we are accomplishing this? How can we know if our audience is deriving the correct meaning from our writing? How can we know if they are achieving this relatively quickly and painlessly? We can ask them! We can (and should!) ask our peers and our colleagues to read our writing and give us feedback. Soliciting feedback on your scientific writing should be an integral part of your writing process. You should also strive to give feedback often, and to a variety of people on a variety of different topics. I would argue that receiving and giving writing feedback are the two best ways to improve our scientific writing - a particular text, but also our skillset in general. When you get feedback on your writing, you should always consider it carefully and critically. If somebody has taken the time to give you feedback, make sure that you go through it all and carefully consider ever part of it. But, do not uncritically accept all feedback. Ultimately, you are the author of the text, and as long as your name is on it, you get to decide what feedback you accept and what you reject. When and Who? Let’s say that the process of writing a paper can generally be broken into 4 major stages (of course, there are many ways to break this down, but bear with me on the 4-stages theory). Once you have your major results and drafts of the most important figures, then you are…. 1. Planning - You’re outlining the paper, deciding on the framing, drafting an abstract, catching up on background lit reading, etc etc. 2. Drafting - You’re writing it all out, getting everything down on the page. 3. Revising - You’re soliciting &amp; implementing feedback from others. 4. Completing - You’re finalizing the paper, double checking citations, polishing the formatting, and submitting. You can (and should) solicit inputs from others at any and every stage of the process. Supervisors and co-authors especially should be involved in Planning, Revising, and Completing. That said, Stage 3: Revising is when you can get the most feedback - since by then you have a draft, others can actually critically evaluate it and give you their impressions and suggestions about your paper. In this stage, you reach out to somebody, asking for them to review what you have written and to critique how you have written it. You then implement that feedback as best as you can and as much as you want, and then likely ask somebody else, and so on and so forth. Whom you ask for feedback will depend on where you are at in this stage and what kind of feedback you want/need. Ideally you will get feedback from a mix of Insiders (at the very least, all co-authors must weigh in!) and Outsiders… Insiders: When you want feedback that generally falls under the question of “Is this correct?”, it is usually better to get feedback from people who are familiar with your study. This includes your supervisor, coauthors, and other people who have a relatively in-depth knowledge about your project and study system. People who are more familiar with, or even involved in, your research are often better at, for example, evaluating whether or not you have framed your paper in such a way that captures the true importance of your study, or helping you to correctly explain and appropriately justify specific aspects of your study design. Outsiders: When you want feedback that generally falls under the question of “Is this clear?”, it’s usually good to get feedback from somebody (or a few people) who is less familiar with your research (but who does have a general grasp of the scientific field). This may include people in your lab, department, or institute who work in the same field but not on the same project/system as you. People who aren’t so familiar with your specific research are often better at, for example, highlighting gaps in info &amp; explanations, or pointing out passages that are confusing or overly-‘jargony.’ Depth of Feedback There are essentially 3 ‘depths’ at which you can get/give feedback. Generally speaking, the deeper the feedback the better! However, that said, giving deep feedback can be very time consuming, and sometimes it is more beneficial to an author for the editor to give shallow feedback on a longer text (e.g., the entire paper), rather than deeper feedback on a shorter text (e.g., only the introduction). So, it’s important to find a balance. Shallow: Where is there a problem? You are marking sections, paragraphs, and/or sentences where the writing is problematic. Where is something unclear or incorrect? Where do you get lost or confused? Where does it feel awkward and foggy in your brain? This feedback could take the form of comments such as “I don’t really understand what you are saying here.” or “I’m not able to follow this line of argument.” or, more generally, “I’m not sure if I understand the motivations behind your study.” Middle: What is the problem? You are attempting to diagnose what the actual source of the confusion/issue is. Is it a structural issue or a phrasing issue? Is there a word or idea or transition that is missing? This feedback could take the form of comments such as “I think the problem might be the structure of this sentence.” or, more generally, “Your introduction is lacking info about the knowledge gap that your study aims to fill.” Deep: How could the problem be fixed? You are attempting to give general and/or specific suggestions that could improve the problematic aspects or parts of a text. You can put comments and/or track-changes directly into the text to show the author how a problem might well be fixed. This feedback could take the form of comments such as “I think you need to flip the order of the clauses in this sentence.” or, more generally, “I think you could add a paragraph here that outlines the knowledge gap that motivated your study - what about this topic do we not know, and why is it important to fill in this blank?” or, edits (track-changes) directly in the document to fix the wording in a sentence. The depth at which you give feedback will likely vary throughout a text (for some problems, you might be able to give deeper feedback than other problems), and will generally depend a lot on the depth of your knowledge of the topic/research, the stage that the writing is at, and how much time you have. The depth at which you take feedback will also vary throughout a text - you might not like the deep feedback that somebody gives you (or their deep feedback might even change a passage to be incorrect!) but the shallow aspect of that feedback (that the presence of these edits indicate where there is a problem) is likely very legitimate - so although you may not take the editors suggested changes, you still need to change the problematic section. Also, it’s important to remember that feedback need not be all about problems with a text! In fact, you can think about positive feedback as having these same levels as well: Shallow positive feedback points out a piece of the text that is particularly effective, Middle positive feedback describes why part of a text is particularly effective, and Deep positive feedback explains how the good aspects of this piece of text could potentially be extrapolated to other, weaker parts of the text. Whenever possible, include positive feedback when you are reviewing a text - this can really help an author to understand what makes their writing effective. When asking for feedback When you ask for (or are asked to give) writing feedback, first discuss the following questions with the author/editor: Who is the audience for this text? What is the planned destination for this text, and what do they require in a text? (e.g., If it’s a grant proposal, what does the granting agency want to see in the proposal?; If it’s a journal article, what journal(s) is the author considering submitting to, and what are this journal’s Instructions for Authors?; etc) What is the current status of the text and on what should the reviewer focus? (see below) What, in particular (e.g., a certain idea/concept or a particular section), is the author struggling with or wanting help on? What is the extent of the editor’s general knowledge about this topic/field of research, and how might that inform the type of feedback they give? Feedback Foci &amp; Format Within the Revising stage of writing, there are 2 major, sequential, foci on which you can ask for feedback (again, bear with me as I break a complex and nebulous process down into discrete, somewhat arbitrary, parcels). It’s important to solicit these two types of feedback in the correct order, starting with Content &amp; Structure, and then - once you have that nailed down - moving on to Language &amp; Clarity.1 1. Content &amp; Structure Here, the focus of the person giving feedback should be the flow of ideas. They should think about what and where information is presented. They should address broader, macro-level questions, such as: Is the importance of the study clear? Is enough background/contextual information given in the intro and discussion? Are the results and implications of the study clear? Is anything missing? Does anything seem superfluous/unnecessary? Do the paragraphs and sections follow a logical, coherent order? Does each paragraph/section have a clear function? Is the paragraph-breaking appropriate? Is there enough detail given in the methods and results that you can understand how the data were collected and analyzed? Are topics/foci presented in the same order through all sections of the text? Of primary importance when asked to give this type of feedback is to not get bogged down in the details. Limit yourself to using comments and to directly discussing your feedback with the author, but try to avoid using track-changes (as this often will shift your mind towards the details). When asked for this type of feedback, I often will print out the paper and work on a hardcopy, as this helps me avoid getting bogged down in language and clarity edits. 2. Language &amp; Clarity Here, the focus of the person giving feedback should be the flow of the writing. They should think about how information is presented. They should address specific, meso- and micro-level questions, such as: Where do you get stuck or confused? Where do you lose interest? How could problem areas be changed to improve readability? Can the writing be made more concise and less wordy? Does each sentence have a clear point/purpose? Does each paragraph have a specific topic and message? Does each sentence flow nicely from the next? Are there sufficient and proper citations (especially in the intro and discussion)? Check for: unnecessary lead-ins, run-on sentences, unclear antecedents, noun-verb accordance, proper punctuation, undefined or unnecessary acronyms, etc Of primary importance when asked to give this type of feedback is to not attempt to overhaul the paper. Unless you really believe that there is a fatal flaw in the content or structure of this paper, try to avoid making broad, macro-level suggestions. Instead, use comments and track-changes to provide specific feedback. Of course, it’s often also a good idea to discuss your feedback with the author (or at least be available to answer any questions that they may have after going through your feedback.) Back to Blog main page Side note: For many, this goes without saying, but some may need this reminder… If somebody is coming to you for writing feedback and they are in the Revising stage of writing, avoid instead giving them feedback about the actual science itself (e.g., the validity of the methods, the appropriateness of the statistical analysis, etc). As they have already - presumably - been through a long process of discussions, data analysis, and paper planning with their co-authors, and the ship has sailed on the science. If you feel that there are weaknesses in the science itself, give them feedback on how they address and/or explain these limitations appropriately, or temper their conclusions accordingly - i.e., writing feedback. If you feel that you have spotted a fatal flaw in their science (something that cannot be explained and that fundamentally invalidates their study), then of course you must point this out. But just generally bear in mind that you have been asked to provide writing feedback, not study design &amp; analysis feedback.↩︎ "],["Abstracts.html", "All About Abstracts Overall content of an abstract Abstract recipe When to write your abstract Annotated abstracts", " All About Abstracts The following information is meant to assist you when you’re writing an abstract for an original research manuscript (though, some of this information will also apply to review &amp; other types of articles). Most journals ask for abstracts with a word limit somewhere between 200-300 words, and - unless instructed otherwise - it’s safe to assume that you should follow a pretty standard format, essentially one that condenses the main parts of your paper, from introduction to conclusion. Remember that, aside from the title, the abstract is the part of your paper that will get read the most, so don’t let it be an afterthought! Put time into crafting an abstract that is clear, concise, interesting, and does justice to your study and full paper. Overall content of an abstract Regardless of the length and specific journal requirements for your abstract, essentially all abstracts should contain the 3 Cs: Context, Content, and Conclusion (Mensh &amp; Kording 2017). Context: Information about the background and/or knowledge gap of this topic. Why should your reader care about your study? Why does your study matter? Why was your study necessary? What knowledge gap did you intend to fill? What research question did you intend to answer? Content: A brief description of what you did and what you found. How did you approach filling the knowledge gap / answering your research question? What was your study system? What did the data show? What were your major results? Conclusion: A summary of the interpretation of your results and their importance. How does this fill the knowledge gap / answer your original question? Why do your results matter? What does your study contribute to this body of knowledge? For abstracts that must be less than ~150 words, you may need to get creative to fit in all of this information. For abstracts of 200+ words, I recommend following the general recipe below… Abstract recipe The following recipe is meant to provide a very basic overview of the standard structure for a 200-300 word abstract. However, it is meant to be a guide, not a rigid rule list! Background, what is known (~1 sentence) Gap, unknown, problem (~1 sentence) Research aim, question, hypothesis (~1 sentence) Approach, study system, methods (~1-2 sentences) Key results, important stats/numbers (~1-3 sentences) Conclusion, answer the question, fill the gap (~1 sentence) Broader implications, meaning, recommendation (~1 sentence) While the general order of Context (#1, #2), Content (#3, #4, #5), and Conclusion (#6, #7) shouldn’t be changed, within these categories there is wiggle room. It is not uncommon for the order of #3 and #4 to be switched (approach and then research aim), nor for the order of #5 and #6 to be switched (overarching conclusion and then specific results). Furthermore, especially where there is a very small word limit, it may be possible to omit #2 (the knowledge gap), as it is implied by #1 (background) and/or #3 (research aims), and/or to collapse #3 (research aims) and #4 (approach) into a single statement. It is always important to check and see if the journal has any specific requirements for abstracts. For example, Nature asks for a “summary paragraph” rather an an “abstract” per se. If you are at all unsure of how to construct an abstract, and if the journal does not give any specifics of how they want it (beyond a simple word limit), following the above recipe is generally a good place to start. When to write your abstract Although everybody’s process is different, it can be a very valuable exercise to write a paper’s abstract first, before writing any of the rest of the paper. If you can fill in all of the ingredients for the recipe above, then you are ready to write your paper. You can then use your abstract as a road map to guide your paper-writing. As you write your paper, and your thinking develops, continue to check back to the abstract and edit/adjust your abstract, or your paper, as necessary. Damien Farine has a great blog post over on academic life histories about how to use your abstract to improve your paper-writing. If you are struggling to satisfy any of the parts of the recipe, then you may need to do more background research, discussing with co-authors, or analysis before you are ready to write your paper. Whatever your process, I encourage you to not leave the abstract until the end, just prior to submission. Remember that it is one of the absolute most important parts of the entire paper, and it should receive the same - if not more - scrutiny (by yourself, co-authors, and others who help to edit your work) as the rest of the paper! Annotated abstracts Here are a few examples of abstracts, which I’ve annotated in accordance with the above abstract recipe… Back to Blog main page "],["Titles.html", "A good title is a simple sticky statement Some good examples", " A good title is a simple sticky statement Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. A good title is a straight-forward statement that communicates a simple message. My general advice for titles is: Make your title the single sticky message that you want your readers to remember; if you can, avoid using a super general statement about the overarching topic of your paper. Don’t use jokes, puns, and references to pop culture; these can confuse - or even deter - potential audience members, as many people (especially those from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds) may not ‘get’ the reference. Two-part titles can be effective - as long as you ensure that both parts of the title directly reflect your main message, but are not redundant. Don’t over-use two-part titles (consider that it’s possible that one part of your two-part title is actually completely unnecessary). I think that the following passage, from Mensh &amp; Kording 2017, does a great job of explaining why a good title is so important, and how considering your title early on can actually help you to write a better paper overall: “The title not only transmits the paper’s central contribution but can also serve as a constant reminder (to you) to focus the text on transmitting that idea. Science is, after all, the abstraction of simple principles from complex data. The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper’s contribution. Thinking about the title early — and regularly returning to hone it — can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories.” — Mensh &amp; Kording 2017; pg. 2 – This passage highlights two important points: Your title should be a distilled statement of your paper’s main message, i.e. it is the “ultimate refinement” of the main message/idea that your paper is all about. You can use the exercise of thinking about and writing your title as a means to help you focus your thinking and your writing of the paper as a whole. Don’t leave writing your title until the very end, instead have it be the first thing you write, and then come back to rethink and refine it as often as necessary as you write the rest of your paper. Some good examples Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015 An excellent title: Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons Why it’s so good: It clearly communicates the main, and exciting, finding (“shared decision-making drives collective moment”) and the study system (“wild baboons”), including the main topics/components of the study (“decision-making,” “collective movement,” and “wild baboons”). It’s short, straight-forward, and sticky: audiences can easily understand and remember this as the main finding of the paper. It also gives insight into not only the study system (“baboons”) but also the approach - the inclusion of the word “wild” suggests to readers that this paper is likely be based on field observations under natural conditions. Less good alternatives: I can imagine a few other, less ideal, titles that the authors could have chosen… Ex 1: How do wild baboons decide where to go? While this captures the main topics/components of the study (“decision-making,” “movement,” “baboons”), it doesn’t actually give the reader any new information. Question titles can be catchy, especially if they ask a question that everybody is already thinking, but what is even better is to actually answer that question up-front—not make the reader comb through the paper to find the answer. Ex 2: Collective decision-making in wild baboons. Again, this title captures the main topics/components of the study, and it’s also quite simple. However, it fails to convey anything about the study’s findings, and so suggests that the study’s results will be anything but straight-forward. While it absolutely can be the case that a study’s results are impossible to condense into a single sticky statement, and a general topic title such as this one may be the best choice, it should only be used as a last resort - after every effort is made to conceptualize and collect results into a single key message. Ex 3: Collective movement in a group-living wild primate: baboons exhibit shared decision-making when choosing when and where to move. While this captures all of the main topics/components, as well as the main finding of the study, it’s not simple… because it’s so long and wordy, it’s more challenging for the audience to parse and to remember: it’s not sticky. This use of the two-part title also includes a lot of redundancy: “a group-living wild primate” and “baboons,” “collective movement” and “when and where to move,” and “decisions-making” and “choosing.” The real title of the paper conveys essentially all of the same information as this alternative but in 9 words instead of 20. Ehmann et al. 2021 An excellent title: Immature wild orangutans acquire relevant ecological knowledge through sex-specific attentional biases during social learning Why it’s so good: It clearly communicates the main, and exciting, finding (“ecological knowledge is acquired through sex-specific attentional biases”) and the study system (“wild orangutans”), including the main topics/components of the study (“immature orangutans,” “ecological knowledge,” “attentional biases” and “social learning”). It’s straight-forward, and pretty sticky: audiences can easily understand and remember this as the main finding of the paper. It also gives insight into not only the study system (“orangutans”) but also the approach - the inclusion of the word “wild” suggests to readers that this paper is likely be based on field observations under natural conditions. It’s not a particularly short title, but I think in this case that’s ok: it’s long because stating the main finding requires several words, and not because it is unnecessarily wordy. I think you could argue, though, that the “during social learning” at the end of the title could maybe have been left off without losing any vital information or obscuring the overall message. Less good alternatives: I can imagine a few other, less ideal, titles that we could have chosen… Ex 1: Growing up in the trees: Immature wild orangutans acquire relevant ecological knowledge through sex-specific attentional biases. This two part title is hardly any longer than the original title, but - rather than emphasizing that these attentional biases occur during social learning, it emphasizes that orangutans are arboreal. Although this is not incorrect, the fact that orangutans are arboreal is not at all important for the framing or main findings of this study. The study does not discuss or analyze the influence of orangutans’ arboreal adaptations or lifestyle on immatures’ attentional biases, so although “growing up in the trees” is true, and maybe gives some contextual information about orangutans’ ecology, it’s not a main point/topic of the study and thus does not belong in the title. Ex 2: Attentional biases among wild immature orangutans. Like example 2 above, this title captures the main topics/components of the study and is simple, but it fails to convey anything about the study’s findings. It’s not very informative, nor exciting, and as such, is not sticky.

Despite what the term suggests, the benefits of using Styles go far beyond just aesthetics. Using Styles allows you to easily see an overview of the organization of a text that you’re writing, which can help you to work out structure and flow. The following is a brief introduction to the way that I use MS Word Styles when I’m writing a manuscript. Of course, there are a lot of additional (and alternative) ways to use Styles, but here is somewhere to start if you’re new to this. The basic principle Imagine that you want to write a text in Times New Roman (TNR) font, with 3 levels of headings: 1) main section headings in bold Arial font, 2) subsection headings in bold TNR font, and 3) sub-sub-headings in TNR italic font. You have two options: You can manually (in the HOME tab) change the font to TNR, start typing, and then anytime you type a heading, you highlight that text and change the font and/or bold/italics. This is the most obvious and common way to do this. ALTERNATIVELY, you can use Styles to “tell” Word what you want your normal text, main headings, subsections headings, and sub-sub-headings to look like. Then, you “tell” Word which text is just normal text, and which is each kind of heading, and it assigns the aesthetic properties that you’ve selected. The Advantages By using Styles (rather than direct manual formatting), you gain 2 major advantages: If you, later, decide that you want to change the aesthetic properties of your paper - let’s say that actually you want main section headings to be Arial bold and italics, and bright red! - you don’t have to go through and change each section heading. You can simply update the Headings style, and all text that has been assigned to that style will be changed. MS Word will recognize which text is actually your headings, subheadings, and sub-sub-headings, etc. This will allow Word to easily construct a table of contents, and also show you the headings structure in the sidebar as you work - allowing you to always see an overview of the text that you’re writing. How it works The following instructions and screenshots are from MS Word for Mac v16.12 - so you’re might look a bit different, but the basic principles should be the same… Open a blank MS Word document, and go to View &gt; Sidebar &gt; Navigation. In the HOME tab, click on the button that says Styles Pane.You should see something that looks like this, with a blank sidebar down the left side, and the Styles Pane on the left… Hover your cursor over the button that says Normal until you see the down arrow on the right. Click on that, and then on “Modify Style.” In the window that pops up, choose the font formatting to be what you want for the default, main text, of your writing. In this case, I’ve changed it to TNR, size 11. Click “OK.” Now, repeat steps 3 and 4 for each Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3 - changing each style to be what you want (in this case, I am making them all size 11 &amp; black, and then Arial bold, TNR bold, and TNR italics respectively.) Note how the look of the different styles changes in the Styles Pane and also in the buttons across the top HOME tab ribbon. You can now close the Styles Pane and begin typing. Type some titles and some text. Highlight text that you want to be each type of style, and then click the appropriate button in the HOME tab ribbon…   Notice how, as you highlight text and assign it a heading style, it will appear in the Navigation Bar on the left side of the screen. Subheadings will be indented under their over-headings. This is a really excellent way for you, your co-authors, and your proof-readers/reviewers to see the full overview of your MS. If you decide later that you want to change the aesthetics of a style - let’s say that you want the subheadings (Heading 2) to be red, you can reopen the Styles Pane, and modify Heading 2 to be red. When you click “OK,” you’ll see that all text which had been assigned to the style Heading 2 has been updated to be red. You can already see in this example that I have used superfluous subheadings - of course, for most journal article manuscripts, you wouldn’t include subheadings for “Background” and “Knowledge Gap.” However, I highly recommend doing this in early drafts. I will often even use a 4th level of subheadings (i.e., Heading 4 style) to give a little title to each paragraph. This makes it really easy to see the overall structure of the paper and to see if/where information might be missing, or superfluous and unnecessary. I especially find this useful in the Methods and Results sections, where I like to include sub(subsub)headings that allow me to see very clearly if each result has a corresponding data collection and/or statistic test method section, and vice versa. Some basic alternatives Of course, you can always start to assign styles to a document that you’ve already started, or finished, writing. You can simply set the aesthetics of the styles that you want, and then go through your text and highlight the different components and click on the style buttons in the HOME tab ribbon. Another way of setting style aesthetics is to: In the document itself, change the aesthetics of a piece of text using the regular font formatting tools (in the HOME tab ribbon, or under Format &gt; Font…). You have likely already been doing this as you typed your text. Open the Styles Pane. Highlight the text that already has the aesthetic properties that you want, but that you want to assign to a specific style. In the Styles Pane, find the name of the specific style that you want the highlighted text to be (in the case of the below example, I want Heading 4 to be size 10, TNR, light grey, italics), hover your cursor over the name, and then click on the down arrow on the right side. Select “Update to Match Selection.” Now, that formatting has been applied to the Headings 4 style. Also, if any other text in the document has already been classified as Headings 4, it will be changed to these new aesthetics. (Note, however, that other text which has that similar formatting, but has not yet been designated as Headings 4 style, will need to be explicitly manually designated, it will not happen automatically.) Adding a TOC While I generally use Styles for the sake of easy mass-aesthetic changes and the usefulness of the Navigation sidebar, you may find that you occasionally want to make a table of contents (TOC). To do this, first put your cursor where you want your table of contents to be (usually the beginning of your document). Then click on the REFERENCES tab and choose Table of Contents from the ribbon, and pick a format from the drop-down menu. Note that, in a cruel twist of fate, table of contents entries have their OWN styles (separate from Headings styles), so the aesthetics that you’ve applied to your heading styles won’t transfer over into the TOC, only the content of those styles (i.e. the text). Super annoying. If you want to change the aesthetics of your table of contents, reopen the Styles Pane in your document, and - now that you’ve added a table of contents - you will see new styles called TOC 1, TOC 2, etc. You can update/modify these styles to match your Heading styles (or not, whatever you want!). Beware There are 2 ways in which using styles can mess you up: First, when you modify the aesthetics of a style, all text that has been assigned to that style will be updated to the new aesthetics. If you have manually (without using styles, just using font formatting tools directly) changed some text’s aesthetics in your document to be different than its assigned style’s aesthetics, it will now get updated to match the new (and other!) modified aesthetics of that style. For example, let’s say that your Normal (i.e. default) aesthetics is TNR size 12. Your reference list is assigned to the Normal style but you have gone ahead and highlighted that section and changed the font size 10. Later, you decide that you want the Normal text to actually be a sans serif font, so you update the Normal style to be Arial (still size 12). Now, ALL text that has been assigned to the Normal style, will be updated! INCLUDING your reference list, which will change from TNR size 10, to Arial size 12 (i.e. you will lose the manual formatting that you did to reduce the size). The way around this is to generally always avoid doing any manual formatting. If you want to change the aesthetics of any text, such as the reference list, or maybe text in a table or in a figure caption, MAKE A NEW “New Style” FOR THAT TYPE OF TEXT. There is a button near the top of the Styles Pane where you can select “New Style…” and give it a name and aesthetic properties. Make a References style, and a table text style, and a figure caption style, rather than just directly formatting the font for these different types of text. Second, it is important to note that styles do not just include font aesthetics, but also other stylistic aspects. The one that often trips me up is paragraph formatting - here, the line spacing and indentation properties of text get encoded in the style. This is helpful if you want to, for example, have a special style for your reference list that includes the unique indentation properties of reference lists (usually, the first line of each ‘paragraph’ is flush with the left margin, while subsequent lines are indented… basically the opposite of regular paragraph indentation patterns). But it also means that you can fall into the above (first) trap with respect to paragraph formatting, not just font formatting. So if you manually set your text to be at 1.5 spacing, but then you update your Normal style to, say, a different font size (but the style’s line spacing is still set to the original 1.0), everything will switch back to 1.0 spacing. The way to avoid these issues are, therefore, to be mindful of the paragraph formatting associated with each style, as well as the font formatting.

Click on the picture of each presentation to open the full presentation in a new tab. Day 1 On the first day, we began the series by discussing what “effective scientific writing” actually means, and then we talked in more detail about the mechanics (content, structure, and language) of effective writing. Day 2 On the second day, we continued our discussion about how we can all be effective scientific writers, by talking in some detail about the mentality (mindset, approach, and workflow) of effective scientific writing. We then discussed the importance and practice of giving and receiving writing feedback. Day 1 and 2 Group Input Because the first two parts of the discussion occurred over zoom, participant input was first solicited via written input into Google Slides, which can been seen here: Day 1 &amp; 2 Group input; 01 &amp; 22 June Day 3 On the third day, we discussed important guidelines and norms related to publishing papers, including affiliations, general acknowledgements, funding acknowledgements, and non-English abstracts. We finished with a lengthy (in-person) discussion about paper authorship (which I have done my best to briefly summarized on the final slide of the presentation linked below). Back to Blog main page "],["Paragraphs.html", "Paragraphs: The basic buidling blocks of text One paragraph = One point Types of paragraphs One final note…", " Paragraphs: The basic buidling blocks of text It’s no secret how much I love good paragraphing. I think of paragraphs as the basic building blocks of a text, and there is nothing nicer to read than a text with well-delineated and well-constructed paragraphs. If an author hasn’t properly ‘chunked’ their writing, then the audience can’t properly ‘chunk’ their reading and interpretation. Reading a text with poor paragraphing is cumbersome and slow at best, at worst it can be confusing and impossible to really understand. As such, proper paragraphing is vital for effective scientific writing. The following is a brief overview of what makes for good paragraphs… One paragraph = One point Generally speaking, a paragraph should be about 3 to 6 sentences long, and should make one single point. If you find that making a point is requiring much more than 6 sentences, then you should consider breaking it down into &gt;1 sub-points, and devoting a paragraph to each. Alternatively, if you find that you have single and double sentence paragraphs, you should consider that either these concepts/ideas need more explanation and context, or they should be grouped with other info under the same overarching point. A good rule of thumb is: You and your readers should be able to summarize the topic of each paragraph in 5 words or less. I recommend actually doing this as an exercise with any text that you are writing or editing - go through the text and try to write the topic of each paragraph in the margin. Notice where you struggle to concisely articulate the point or topic of a paragraph - is this because the paragraph is too long? too unfocused? meandering from one topic to another? generally unclear? It’s important to remember that what constitutes “one single point” will depend on the resolution of your writing, which itself will depend on your writing goals, i.e. what you want your audience to take away from each section of your text. For example, if I need my audience to understand the nuanced ways in which various factors have been shown to influence primates’ daily travel distance, I would likely devote a paragraph to reviewing the relationship between daily travel distances and each of the major categories of influential factors; for example, 1) a paragraph about habitat factors (structure, heterogeneity, and food resource availability levels), 2) a paragraph about intrinsic factors (species, body size, individuals’ age-sex class and reproductive status/phase), and 3) a paragraph about social factors (group size, intergroup competition, overall gregariousness), etc. However, if I simply need my audience to understand that variation in primates’ movement is linked to variation in a variety of internal, external, and environmental factors, then this information could all be condensed and summarized at a higher level in a single paragraph. Types of paragraphs Knowing how to arrange sentences within a paragraph is also really important. Generally, there are 3 types of paragraphs in scientific writing, each with their own internal structure. The type of paragraph that you use to make a particular point will depend on the type of information that you need to present in order to make that point. There is no hard grammatical rule that every paragraph must be one of these three types, but if you follow one of these three road-maps for each of your paragraphs, you will likely find that you are better able to organize your ideas and thoughts, and that your audience has an easier time understanding your message. Top-down paragraphs Top-down paragraphs start with a sentence that states the main message of the paragraph, followed by a few sentences of support to substantiate the main message, and then they end with an emphasis sentence that states the most important aspect of the point being made (and also often serves as a transition towards the topic of the next paragraph). These paragraphs are useful when you want to discuss or review the evidence for a given fact or idea that your audience is likely generally familiar with or that is pretty straight-forward - you present this topic/idea, then back it up, then emphasize it’s importance or relationship to an overarching topic and/or to the next point that you will make. This type of paragraph is common in paper Introductions, when an author presents a concept, then reviews literature related to that concept, then emphasizes the part of that concept that is most important for their study. Bottom-up paragraphs Bottom-up paragraphs start with an introduction sentence, followed by a few sentences of analysis to give context and/or to situate the main message, and then they end with the main message giving the ‘take-away’ point of the paragraph. These paragraphs are useful when you want to present a new or complex idea/point - you begin by introducing the general topic (start where you can be sure that your audience will be with you), then you build from there (giving context, analyzing relationships, etc) to the conclusion or take-away message that you want your audience to know. This type of paragraph is common in paper Discussions, when an author is presenting a result from their study, then contextualizing it in the literature, and giving the implication or take-home message related to that result. Sequence paragraphs Sequence paragraphs present information in ordered steps, from a start to an end, and usually begin and/or end with a purpose and/or outcome sentence, respectively. If the purpose comes at the beginning, it usually introduces the goal or the intention of the following sequence of events, whereas an outcome sentence at the end sums up the results or implications of the sequence of events. These paragraphs are useful when you want to present ordered information, such as a narrative of events (for example, the history of research on a particular subject, or the steps taken during data collection, an experiment, or an analysis). This type of paragraph is common in paper Methods, when an author is describing the sequential steps taken to achieve a particular methodological goal. Bear in mind that even if you are presenting a sequence of events, you should still aim to paragraph your text into 3-6 sentence chunks, each with its own purpose and/or outcome. If you require many more sentences than this (if there are too many steps that absolutely cannot warrant their own purpose and/or outcome), and in the case of methodological procedures, consider reformatting your text into a numbered list of steps, rather than writing it out in paragraph-form. One final note… A very basic, but vitally important, aspect of paragraphing is paragraph breaks - i.e. the indication that one paragraph is ending and another is beginning. This can be indicated in two ways: 1) A blank line can be inserted after the end of a paragraph, so there is extra blank space before the next paragraph begins (i.e. if your document is double spaced, then there would be the equivalent of three blank lines between paragraphs), or 2) The beginning of each new paragraph is indented (usually by 1 tab, which is equal to 5 to 10 spaces) from the left margin. It is not necessary, but also not incorrect, to do both of these things. It is, however, incorrect to do neither of these two things; you cannot simply hit “enter” and start a new paragraph, without indentation, on the next new line directly after the previous paragraph. Back to Blog main page "],["Macrostructure.html", "Common Macrostructure of an Original Research Paper Title Abstract Keywords Introduction Methods Results Discussion", " Common Macrostructure of an Original Research Paper The following is from a handout that I give to students who are embarking on writing their first paper. There is no hard rule that says one must follow this structure, but if you are feeling like you don’t know what you’re doing, and what to write where, this might be a helpful place to start. Of course, you should always check the author guidelines for your target journal, as many have specific macrostructure requirements. Furthermore, look at several papers published in your target journal, and see what sort of length and structure they have, and then aim to mimic this as closely as you can with your own paper. However, that said, if you follow the macrostructure below, your paper should be relatively adaptable to the specific structural requirements of any journal. Title A straight-forward statement that communicates the main finding, or topic, of your paper (For more details, see my post about titles). Abstract A summary, or “road map,” of your paper. The following is a common abstract “recipe” for a scientific paper: Background, what is known (~1 sentence) Gap, unknown, problem (~1 sentence) Study aim (~1 sentence) Study system and approach (~1-2 sentences) Key results (~1-3 sentences) Conclusion, answer the question, fill the gap (~1 sentence) Broader implications, meaning, recommendation (~1 sentence) For more details, see my post about abstracts. Keywords Important terms pertaining to the major topics/themes of your paper that are not in your title or abstract. Introduction What does my audience need to know in order to understand and care about my study? Background Why is this topic important? What is already known about this topic? Summarize previous research at a high level, don’t get bogged down in unnecessary details. Knowledge gap What do we not know yet, and why do we need to know this? Narrow in towards your specific study question. Study system Justify your choice of study system. Summarize the necessary background (what is already known) about this topic in your study system. Outline the knowledge gap with respect to your study system. This study Broadly summarize your study’s objective/question, your hypotheses/predictions, and approach. Give a brief overview of the experimental design, observational set-up, and/or analytical/statistical approach. Methods What does my audience need to know in order to trust and replicate my study? You need to: Demonstrate that you used a scientifically valid method. Give all info that would be required for somebody to redo your study. This is the most ‘specialized’ part of your paper – be very specific! Break it into logical/meaningful subsections. Results What does my audience need to know in order to trust the conclusions of my study? Plainly describe what your data and statistical tests show. Put the biology up front, and the stats and technical details afterwards. Use figures and tables as the focal points, build the text around these. Break into subsections, e.g., one per major result or overarching question. Discussion What does my audience need to know in order to understand the meaning and implications of my results? Fill the knowledge gap Broadly summarize your major results. Explicitly state how your result(s) fill (partly or in full) the knowledge gap presented in your introduction. This part should be understandable to somebody who hasn’t read the methods and results, but rather has skipped straight here after reading the last paragraph of your intro. Explain each major result For each result (or group of related results), explain why this result was what it was, using evidence from the literature. Does this result agree with, or differ from, previous similar studies? What does this agreement or difference mean? What can be extrapolated from other studies to better understand this result? Address limitations &amp; caveats To what extent are your results not generalizable? How might the limitations of your study have influence the results you found? Implications &amp; take-home message Sum it all up by distilling your main results to their logical conclusion.
