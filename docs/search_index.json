My job is to support other department members in the communication of their science to scientific audiences. This includes support with everything from writing papers and grant proposals, to putting together conference presentations, to designing (and coding) data visualizations. If you have any questions or comments, or are interested in receiving my help for something you’re working on, please feel free to contact me. Alie aashbury@ab.mpg.de Bückle 5.27 This website is meant to be a source of support for those looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Please note, this website is still very much under construction! Contents The information on this website is divided into several categories: 2 Alie’s Programs: Details about the specific programs and services that I offer to department members. 3 Scientific Writing: Lists and links of helpful resources related to scientific writing. 4 Scientific Presentations: Coming soon! 5 Data Visualization: Coming soon! 6 Alie’s Blog: Posts about anything related to scientific communication. I built this website with bookdown, using the EAS template made by Kosmas Hench. "],["alies_programs.html", "2 Alie’s Programs Writing Support Writing Solidarity Club Writing Retreat Writing Workshop", " 2 Alie’s Programs The following programs are available to members of the EAS department. Contact me for more info! Writing Support Once each week, I have a slot of ~4 hours which I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. When you “book” the slot, you get up to 4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I’ll spend 3-4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, maybe you only want to meet to discuss some ideas or parts of a writing project that you’re stuck on. Or, maybe you want to give a practice talk for a conference, and receive feedback about your presentation and slides. Basically, it’s totally flexible, so think specifically about what you are hoping that I can help you with, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. Sign up in the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning “Scientific Writing Support with Alie” slot that doesn’t yet have somebody’s name in it. Replace “[Name]” with your name. By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary! Sign up for the Wednesday slot to claim my time that week, but then contact me to sort out an alternative day/time. Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time! If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary. Writing Solidarity Club Note: This program is on hold until further notice. If you are interested in this program, please contact me directly to let me know! Lots of writing to do, but can’t find the motivation? Need extra incentive to block off writing time? Come to Writing Solidarity Club! Bring your laptop and leave your over-active inner-critic behind! It’s writing time! Every Tuesday, from 14:30 to 16:30, I will be writing in Bückle room 4.06 (the conference room next to MPI-AB reception). Anybody is welcome to join! No sign up required.

Start by asking: Who is my audience? What are their goals in reading my writing? What message do I want them to take away from my writing?” - Turbek et al. 2016 “A scientific research paper is the product of erasure. It’s all that is left over after everything has been stripped off except for exactly what needs to be there.” - Judy Swan “You succeed as a scientist by getting [your papers] cited.” - Joshua Schimel, Writing Science The above quotes highlight several key qualities of effective scientific writing &amp; writers. To be an effective scientific writer…. You need to understand the importance of writing well. Invest in yourself as a writer. Take the time to learn and improve. You should write for your audience - every word, sentence, and paragraph that you write should be chosen and crafted to convey a specific message to your audience. You should write concisely. You need to cut clutter that will distract your audience from your main message. Your overarching goal is to get cited; It is not enough to get published - people actually need to use your work. Only when others are citing your work - because they are discussing it, building off it, or using it to inform their own work - has your research truly become part of the scientific body of knowledge. Resources Books When I find books about scientific writing that I think are really good and helpful, I will list them here and also ask that they be ordered for our department. So you should be able to find the following books on our 5th floor mini library: Writing Science by Joshua Schimel Scientific Writing and Communication by Angelika H. Hoffman Papers Simple rules for concise scientific writing; Hotaling 2020 is a great paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and writing scientific papers, with a focus on keeping things “tight” and concise. Ten simple rules for structuring papers, Mensh &amp; Kording 2017 is an excellent paper that outlines 10 rules for approaching and structuring a paper, so as to make it as easy as possible for your audience to understand your message. Finding the “Pitch” in Ecological Writing, Cahill et al. 2011 is about how to approach writing a scientific paper, such that it is catchy and sticks with your readers. Online resources The Duke Graduate School Scientific Writing Resource consists of 3 sections (lessons) all aimed at teaching you how to write more effectively. In this lecture, entitled Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks, Judy Swan discusses what makes for good writing, and how to get readers to pay the most attention to what you think is the most important. Courses Writing in the Sciences, offered by Stanford University on Coursera, is a free class that covers big-picture and detailed nitty-gritty best practices of scientific writing. The focus is on original research manuscripts, but review papers and grant proposals and other types of written work are also covered. The course also reviews the writing process, with tips for how to approach writing projects. Although the examples are mostly taken from medical/clinical research, the lessons are taught clearly and can easily be applied to ecology/animal behavior research. Suggestions? If you come across a good scientific writing resource, please let me know about it! Other The following are resources that I’ve come across, but haven’t yet had a chance to read through and fully vet. When I do, if I like them, I’ll move them to the lists above.

The idea here is to give authors a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they’d like, and to give editors some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text. "],["FF.html", "Feedback Framework Preliminary questions The categories of writing feedback", " Feedback Framework The following information is meant to assist you when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give authors a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they’d like, and to give editors some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text. It is important to remember that: Writing is not a linear process - i.e. although most papers start with planning and end with polishing, they do not necessarily progress from planning to polishing in a linear sequential way, e.g. a paper may move back and forth between planning and content a few times, or a re-structuring might be necessary along with the ‘final’ polishing edits; and These categories are not discrete - e.g. when planning, you will of course consider content and structure, or adjustments to language may precipitate adjustments to structure, and vice-versa. The important thing here is that you - as an author - can articulate the type(s) of feedback that you want/need at any given time, and that you - as an editor - can understand the type(s) of feedback that an author is asking for. Preliminary questions When you ask for, or are asked to give, writing feedback, first discuss the following questions with the author/editor: What are the requirements for this text? / What is the planned destination for this text? / Who is the audience for this text? (ex. If a grant proposal, what does the granting agency want to see in the proposal?; If a journal article, what journal(s) is the author considering submitting to?; etc) What is the current status of the text and what type of feedback does the author want? (see below) What, in particular (a certain idea/concept or a particular section), is the author struggling with or wanting help on? The categories of writing feedback Planning The author: - is still chewing over ideas - has done a lot of reading &amp; research - has some notes - has a rough outline/overview While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: What is/are the main point/s the author wants to make? What is the overarching story of this text? What does the audience need to know in order for the author’s main point/s to have an impact? The editor should: - familiarize themselves (if they are not already) with the general topic / study system / field of research - discuss the project with the author - clarify questions/aims/goals of the text - identify areas where further reading &amp; research is needed - help to develop an approach, structure, and maybe an outline Content The author: - has a first draft (though it’s not pretty, and many ideas may be still half-baked) or at least a thorough outline - has thought about out the general content - has a preliminary idea of the over-arching structure of the text While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: Is the central idea of the text framed in an interesting and engaging way? Is the author’s main point clearly explained, and enough background/ contextual information given for it to make sense? Does the framing/contextualization of the topic make clear why this topic/problem is important? Is anything missing? Does anything seem superfluous/unnecessary? Does every method have a result and vice versa? Do the data and analysis support the conclusions? The editor should: - use comments to put feedback into the text - identify areas that aren’t clear, ideas that don’t fit, and concepts that are missing - only note language-related edits when necessary to clarify the meaning of a sentence - focus on the content of the text and not on how it is written Structure The author: - has a full draft of the text - has basically finalized the draft content, and fully fleshed out the ideas While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: Does each sentence, paragraph, and section have a clear point/message? Can you quickly and easily summarize the topic/focus of each paragraph? Generally, does each paragraph begin with a topic sentence, end with an emphasis or concluding sentence, and have supporting information in the middle? Is information all in the right places (background, knowledge gap, approach in Intro; no Methods mixed in with the Results; no Discussion/interpretation mixed in with the Results; etc)? Are topics/foci presented in the same order through all sections of the text? The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - add comments where more extensive edits are needed - identify information that is out of place - check for parallel structure(s) - check paragraph structures - focus more on where information/ideas are presented, and on the ordering of these, and less on how it is written Language The author: - has a full, well-structured draft of the text While working through the text, the editor should ask themselves: As you read through, where do you get stuck or confused? How could problem areas be changed to improve readability? Does each sentence flow nicely from the next? Are details introduced properly and relationally? Check for: run-on sentences, noun-verb accordance, proper punctuation, etc The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - add comments to explain changes and to highlight recurring errors - identify passages that may need to be rewritten or reworked for more clarification - note ideas or suggestions of how to change problem passages (in comments or track-changes) - focus on how the text is written, be thorough Polishing The author: - has the text finished and in its “final” form - has a submission deadline (if applicable) quickly approaching While working through the text, the editor should check that: …jargon is defined, abbreviations are written out in full the first time, terminology is consistent throughout the text, punctuation is used correctly, etc The editor should: - track-changes to mark suggested edits in the text - put in as few changes as possible to ensure clarity and readability of the text - mark awkward sentences/sections as needing to be reworked – make suggestions of how, if possible - try to preserve the author’s writing as much as possible, while still ensuring clarity and flow Back to Blog main page "],["Abstracts.html", "All About Abstracts Overall content of an abstract Abstract recipe When to write your abstract Annotated abstracts", " All About Abstracts The following information is meant to assist you when you’re writing an abstract for an original research manuscript (though, some of this information will also apply to review &amp; other types of articles). Most journals ask for abstracts with a word limit somewhere between 200-300 words, and - unless instructed otherwise - it’s safe to assume that you should follow a pretty standard format, essentially one that condenses the main parts of your paper, from introduction to conclusion. Remember that, aside from the title, the abstract is the part of your paper that will get read the most, so don’t let it be an afterthought! Put time into crafting an abstract that is clear, concise, interesting, and does justice to your study and full paper. Overall content of an abstract Regardless of the length and specific journal requirements for your abstract, essentially all abstracts should contain the 3 Cs: Context, Content, and Conclusion (Mensh &amp; Kording 2017). Context: Information about the background and/or knowledge gap of this topic. Why should your reader care about your study? Why does your study matter? Why was your study necessary? What knowledge gap did you intend to fill? What research question did you intend to answer? Content: A brief description of what you did and what you found. How did you approach filling the knowledge gap / answering your research question? What was your study system? What did the data show? What were your major results? Conclusion: A summary of the interpretation of your results and their importance. How does this fill the knowledge gap / answer your original question? Why do your results matter? What does your study contribute to this body of knowledge? For abstracts that must be less than ~150 words, you may need to get creative to fit in all of this information. For abstracts of 200+ words, I recommend following the general recipe below… Abstract recipe The following recipe is meant to provide a very basic overview of the standard structure for a 200-300 word abstract. However, it is meant to be a guide, not a rigid rule list! Background, what is known (~1 sentence) Gap, unknown, problem (~1 sentence) Research aim, question, hypothesis (~1 sentence) Approach, study system, methods (~1-2 sentences) Key results, important stats/numbers (~1-3 sentences) Conclusion, answer the question, fill the gap (~1 sentence) Broader implications, meaning, recommendation (~1 sentence) While the general order of Context (#1, #2), Content (#3, #4, #5), and Conclusion (#6, #7) shouldn’t be changed, within these categories there is wiggle room. It is not uncommon for the order of #3 and #4 to be switched (approach and then research aim), nor for the order of #5 and #6 to be switched (overarching conclusion and then specific results). Furthermore, especially where there is a very small word limit, it may be possible to omit #2 (the knowledge gap), as it is implied by #1 (background) and/or #3 (research aims), and/or to collapse #3 (research aims) and #4 (approach) into a single statement. It is always important to check and see if the journal has any specific requirements for abstracts. For example, Nature asks for a “summary paragraph” rather an an “abstract” per se. If you are at all unsure of how to construct an abstract, and if the journal does not give any specifics of how they want it (beyond a simple word limit), following the above recipe is generally a good place to start. When to write your abstract Although everybody’s process is different, it can be a very valuable exercise to write a paper’s abstract first, before writing any of the rest of the paper. If you can fill in all of the ingredients for the recipe above, then you are ready to write your paper. You can then use your abstract as a road map to guide your paper-writing. As you write your paper, and your thinking develops, continue to check back to the abstract and edit/adjust your abstract, or your paper, as necessary. Damien Farine has a great blog post over on academic life histories about how to use your abstract to improve your paper-writing. If you are struggling to satisfy any of the parts of the recipe, then you may need to do more background research, discussing with co-authors, or analysis before you are ready to write your paper. Whatever your process, I encourage you to not leave the abstract until the end, just prior to submission. Remember that it is one of the absolute most important parts of the entire paper, and it should receive the same - if not more - scrutiny (by yourself, co-authors, and others who help to edit your work) as the rest of the paper! Annotated abstracts Here are a few examples of abstracts, which I’ve annotated in accordance with the above abstract recipe… Back to Blog main page "]]
