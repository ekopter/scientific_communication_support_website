# Alie's Programs {#alies_programs}



The following programs are available to members of the EAS department. Contact me for more info!

## Writing Support {-}

Once each week, I have a slot of ~4 hours which I can dedicate towards helping a department member with a scientific communication task/project. 

When you "book" the slot, you get up to 4 hours of my time that week, and we can use that time in whatever way would be most beneficial to you. 

So, for example, if you want edits on a paper, you could send me the draft, and I'll spend 3-4 hours reading it and putting in comments/edits, and then I can send it back to you, and we meet to discuss. Or, maybe you only want to meet to discuss some ideas or parts of a writing project that you're stuck on. Or, maybe you want to give a practice talk for a conference, and receive feedback about your presentation and slides. Basically, it's totally flexible, so think specifically about what you are hoping that I can help you with, and how best to structure up to 4 hours of time in order to achieve that. 

***Sign up*** in the EAS department google calendar, look for a Wednesday morning "Scientific Writing Support with Alie" slot that doesn't yet have somebody's name in it. Replace "[Name]" with your name. 

By default, this slot is on Wednesday mornings, however, it can be moved if necessary! Sign up for the Wednesday slot to claim my time that week, but then contact me to sort out an alternative day/time.

***Reach out to me a day or two before your slot so that we can discuss your needs and strategize about how best to use the time!***

If you are working towards a tight deadline, and you need help before the next available slot, contact me! I can often be flexible and give you time sooner if necessary.  
  
  
## Writing Retreat {-}

Writing retreats are an opportunity for department members to enjoy a change of pace and scenery, and devote some quality time to writing up their science in a collective and supportive environment.

Each day at a Retreat, we set our goals in the morning, write independently together in a conference room throughout the day, and then reflect/check-in on our progress in the evenings. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided, as well as 2 coffee breaks each day. Participants are also welcome to plan/lead group activities (e.g. walks/hikes/jogs around the area, movie nights, yoga sessions, etc), and take alone time as they need.

To get the most out of a Retreat, we want participants to arrive ready to write, which involves some preparatory work ahead of time. About 6 weeks before a Retreat, I check-in with each participant and we discuss what they'll work on at the Retreat, where they are at in their writing preparation process, and further steps that they need to take before the Retreat (e.g. completing analyses, meeting with a collaborator or supervisor).

Last fall (2022), we will had our first EAS Writing Retreat at the [Hotel St Elisabeth Hegne](https://www.st-elisabeth-hegne.de/hotel-st-elisabeth.html) from November 21st to the 25th.

***Stay tuned for info about or next EAS Writing Retreat, which will take place in Spring 2023!***
  

## Co-Writing Thursdays {-}

Co-writing days take place every Thursday, and up to 4 people can join each day. We start at 9am and write until 5pm, following a set schedule of writing blocks and breaks. During writing sessions, we sit together in the same room and work quietly and independently on our own writing. Like a mini writing retreat, writing together can be really motivating and can help with staying focused.

***If you'd like to participate in a co-writing day, [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xdXCNQEE3PODH2Q4aI1c7A3heXJXacsQPLYiY-1O2Ps/edit?usp=sharing)!***

If there are no open spots, add your name to the wait list and check back the day before to see if a slot has openned up! 

We need a minimum of 2 participants for the co-writing day to take place. Please check the sign up sheet on Wednesday at 17:00; Unfortuantely, if you are the only person signed up for the next day, then co-writing is cancelled, sorry!!

  
## Writing Feedback Workshop {-}

Do you have a manuscript that you're working on, and you're at a point where you'd really like to poll your future audience to find out what they think of the writing? Are you kinda stuck on a paper and not sure what direction to take it in terms of the story, framing, etc? Are you wondering if your manuscripts makes sense to anybody except you and your favorite co-author? 

***If so, let me know! We can organize a Writing Feedback Workshop for your manuscript!***

A Writing Feedback Workshop allows you to get a lot of feedback, from different points of view, on your manuscript. This feedback is focussed on the *writing* (not the science, per se), i.e., the focus is on *how* you have presented and communicated your study/research, rather than on the scientific value and validity of that study/research. 

The way it works:

1. We set a time (at least 1 week in the future) and a place (could also be on zoom!) and advertise it to the department.
2. You fill out a special cover page that preemptively answers questions about the type of feedback you'd like to get. You attach this to your manuscript.
3. People who are interested in participating will contact you, and you send them your manuscript (with the cover page).
4. Participants (including myself) read your draft and put in comments and/or track-changes, and/or make notes about their feedback. 
5. During the time of the workshop, we go through the manuscript from start to end (and/or focus on the relevant sections). Participants can make suggestions, ask questions, give their impressions, etc. You, the author, can discuss these suggestions, ask questions, present alternatives, etc. It's basically just a helpful, friendly, discussion in which you receive ideas and suggestions on how you could improve the writing of your paper. I can facilitate this workshop for/with you, or you can take the lead if you want!
6. If participants feel that they have other important pieces of feedback that didn't get covered during the workshop, they can send you their annotated copies of the manuscript.
7. You consider participants' feedback carefully and critically, and move forward confidently with your manuscript writing!
