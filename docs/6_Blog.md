## [All About Abstracts](#Abstracts) {-}

Here, you can learn about how to structure an abstract for an original research manuscript (bonus, some of this information also applies to review & other types of articles). 
  
  
  
## [Feedback framework](#FF) {-}

Here, you can find a tool to help you communicate when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give **authors** a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they'd like, and to give **editors** some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text.
