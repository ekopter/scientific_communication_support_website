## [A good title is a simple sticky statement](#Titles) {-}

Without a doubt, the part of your paper that will get read the most often, and by the widest audience, is your title. Ideally, your title will be successful at signalling to your primary intended audience that this paper is for them, as well as signalling to everybody what the main message of your paper is. In this post, I go over what makes for a good title.
  
  
  
## [All About Abstracts](#Abstracts) {-}

Here, you can find a tool to help you communicate when asking for and giving feedback on scientific writing projects. The idea here is to give **authors** a general framework and language for discussing the stage that their text is at and the type of feedback that they'd like, and to give **editors** some guidelines for what to think about and what to pay attention to when going through the text.
