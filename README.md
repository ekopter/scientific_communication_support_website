# Ecology of Animal Societies - Bookdown Template


This website is meant to be a source of support for EAS Department members looking for assistance with their scientific communication - this is where I will compile information and resources that I regularly give/recommend to people. Click the link to the right, above, to view the website properly.


I've used a {[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)} template developed by [Kosmas](https://k-hench.github.io/eas_bookdown/) for this website.


You can have a look at the [compiled documentation](https://k-hench.github.io/eas_bookdown/) for more information about this template.
